This project, awarded **Best Overall** at the [**CUSP London Data Dive 2025**](https://cusplondon.ac.uk/), explores the spatial drivers of **fuel poverty** in London using advanced spatial analysis techniques. By integrating multiple datasets, we identified key socio-economic and energy-related factors contributing to fuel poverty and developed actionable policy recommendations tailored to regional disparities.  

## Approach  
- **Data Integration**: Combined datasets on household income, energy efficiency, electricity consumption, and housing characteristics.  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Applied **Moran’s I** and **Local Moran’s I** to identify clustering patterns of fuel poverty across London.  
- **Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)**: Modeled spatial variation in fuel poverty drivers, highlighting significant variables such as income, building age, energy efficiency, and electricity consumption.  
- **Policy Insights**: Proposed targeted, region-specific interventions to address disparities in energy access and affordability.
